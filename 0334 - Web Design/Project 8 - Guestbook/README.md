## Project Description and [Project Link](http://www.alectrievel.com/schoolwork/CS0334/project8/guestbook.html)

For this lab, you are to use HTML, CSS, and PHP to create a "guest book" where the user enters information into a form and provides some feedback/comments at the bottom of the form.  Clicking a "submit" button would then send the data to a file.

* The design and format is entirely up to you.....make it "pleasing to the eye" for the end-user.
* Lab will be assessed on your proper utilization of HTML, CSS, and PHP file functions.
* The form MUST ask for:
  * first name
  * last name
  * address
  * school attending 
  * a comment
  * and it MUST ask for AT LEAST 4 additional items
