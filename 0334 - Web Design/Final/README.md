## Project Description and [Project Link](http://www.alectrievel.com/schoolwork/CS0334/final/)

 Implement a web-based store system that utilizes examples from Chapters 11 and 12 of the textbook.  Your online store should provide the following:

1. An ability for a user to query the "inventory" (of shoes, or hats, or whatever) based on two separate criteria (gender and size, for example); this will require utilization of php, html, and sql

2. Utilization of at least five different html files: inventory, enter customer information, display price, store information, etc.

You will be presenting your end result in class during the last week of class (See Week 15 and Final Exam/Lab folders for the schedule). Besides providing a link to your final product, you are to make a presentation (5-minutes max) to the class about your project, explaining your utilization of CSS, HTML, PHP, MySQL to accomplish it.

Grade will be determined by your proper utilization of HTML, PHP, CSS, SQL, and by your presenting your final product in class.
