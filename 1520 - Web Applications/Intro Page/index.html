        My name is Alec Trievel and I am a senior Computer Science Major with a minor in German Language
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the summer I interned as a Full Stack developer and had a great time learning so much about web development.</p>
      <p>
        After graduating, I hope to use the skills I cultivated over the summer and through my education to purse a career as a Full Stack developer.
